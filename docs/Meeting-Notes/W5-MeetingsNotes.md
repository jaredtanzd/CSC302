# Week 5 Meeting Notes

### 1. Call to Order
A meeting was held at 33 Charles St East on 8 October 2022.

### 2. Attendees
* Regan
* Riley
* Jared

### 3. Open Issues
* ***Remaining timeline for the project***
    * Clean and visualize data
    * Create a suitable machine learning pipeline to achieve the desired outcomes
    * Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and optimizing parameters to ensure that we have found the best possible set of algorithms and parameters to achieve our desired outcomes. 
    * Visualize the data and results to ensure that the outcome is meaningful for users. 
    * Lastly, we need to improve the user interface such that anyone can easily input their parameters and obtain meaningful results.


* ***Progress of each team member***
    * Riley
        * <b>ITEM:</b> Clean and visualize data. Have been preoccupied with recapping on data science theories and revising by looking at past projects. 
        * <b>PROGRESS:</b> NOT STARTED. By 15 October, Riley will need to be able to produce a cleaned, usable dataset for Regan to proceed with implementing machine learning algorithms to achieve the expected output

    * Regan
        * <b>ITEM:</b> Revise various machine learning algorithms, and deepen understanding on how to create a suitable machine learning pipeline for the purpose of this project. 
        * <b>PROGRESS:</b> NOT STARTED, can only start implementing machine learning algorithms on 15 October.
        * <b>ITEM:</b> Write meeting objectives (to be filled up) for 5 October and disseminate the information to the rest of the team.
        * <b>PROGRESS:</b> COMPLETED
    * Jared
        * <b>ITEM:</b> Review and revise good testing practices and attempt to start acceptance tests on our first iteration of the product. 
        * <b>PROGRESS:</b> COMPLETED
        * <b>ITEM:</b> Review and rewrite read.me file on github 
        * <b>PROGRESS:</b> COMPLETED
    


* ***Review on Features to be implemented (TO DO LIST)*** <br />

    <b>Priority Levels</b><br/>
    <b>I</b>: Top priority, has to be done by the next meeting (should have only one top priority tasks per meeting<br/>
    <b>II</b>: Mid priority, may not be able to be done as of today. Responsible team members to be revising and be ready to finish as soon as possible<br/>
    <b>III</b>: Low priority, good to do but no urgency at the current stage of project

    * Cleaned data suitable to train machine learning models
        * Priority: I
        * Rationale: Data cleaning and mining is the most important step of this entire project, since we do not know what we can or cannot do if we do not clean the data. This will impact the course of the project as well as other features that we might want to implement in the future

    * Machine learning model pipeline
        * Priority: II
        * Rationale: The entire machine learning pipeline will form the foundation of our project, and the effectiveness of the solution for the issue at hand. This will decide what additional features can be added into the project in the future.


    * Types of verification tests for each of the features
        * Priority: III
        * Rationale: Since the project has yet to have any substantial progress, there is almost nothing to be tested on. What is more important is that Jared thinks of future tests which will be useful.
